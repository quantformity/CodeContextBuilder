# CodeContextBuilder
A high-performance architectural mapping tool designed to transform complex codebases into "AI-ready" environments. It acts as a bridge between raw source code and coding agents (like Gemini, Claude, and GPT) by generating a Distributed Context System—a network of structured Markdown   files that live alongside the code.
